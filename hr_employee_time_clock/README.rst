Employee Time Clock
==============================

Employee Time Clock calculates over and undertime based on attendances and contracts/time schedules.
Over- undetime is displayed and stored in employees timesheets. The manager see the current saldo of the timesheet and the overall saldo from beginning as well.

The module adds an additional report as well, where managers can analyse attendances, worked hours and over- undertime.
Several analysis settings can be configured, like:
 - Tolerance for sign-in and sign-out
 - Attendances and overtimes rounding
 - Different types of overtime, according to the overtime amount

This module is well integrated with our iPhone / iPad apps, which gives the employees the possibility to signIn/signOut by mobile app or on the 
entrance of your company where the time clock station app is mounted with a 2D barcode card. They can see there over- undertime saldo as well.
In anycase, the module works without the mobile apps as well.
