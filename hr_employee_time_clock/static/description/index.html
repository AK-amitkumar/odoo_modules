            <h3>Sign in/out with 2d barcode</h3>
            <p class="oe_mt32">
                An employee can sign in/out with holding his 2d code card to the front cam. The check-in process automatically detects if the user is currently signed in or out and executes the following step. The employee gets a quick overview of his over- and under-time total. <strong>Employees don't even need an odoo user.</strong> <br/><br/>
			</p>
			<p class="oe_mt32">
			<h4>Producing the 2d cards is easy and without additional costs</h4>
				You can export your employees data from odoo as excel (name and id) and create the 2d barcode stickers by yourself with your printer. Use e.g. the Herma online tool for all herma sticker formats: <a href="http://www.herma.de/de/service/gratis-software/etikettenassistent-online.html">Herma online tool</a>. The tool allows you to create your desired design inclusive logo and generate a pdf for printing.<br/><br/>
